## About

This is kinda social network for bookworms. Anyone has "wishes" and "propositions" lists, visible to anybody else. So a user can:
* View anyone's wishes and propositions;
* Contact;
* Just chat about books and have fun.

## Usage

To run the web server on your machine, you need to do following:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements (with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run Flask Webb App (`run.sh` on LINUX and `run.bat` on Windows)

## Contributing

At the moment this is my pet project. But if some serious contributors and/or product managers come into, that can be a large startup with possible benefits and fun.

P.S. Before the project grows big, I might come up with some `CONTRIBUTING.md` stuff.
